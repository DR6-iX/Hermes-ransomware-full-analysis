## 1. Resolving APIs and decrypting consts <a name="1-resolving-apis-and-decrypting-constants"></a>
The program begins with the decryption of constant values with xor with an obfuscated key.

* ![Decryption of Obfuscated Key](Images/1-DecryptionOfObfuscatedKey.png)

In the same function, the malwares retrieves various APIs. The fun part is that for `kernel32.dll`, developer tried to obfuscate the string with the following algorithm:
* ![Funny way of obfuscating kernel32 string](Images/2-FunnyWayOfObfuscatingKernel32String.png)

And then place all characters in the right order to make `kernel32.dll`. It then imports it and
search for LoadLibraryA to load other dlls, by iterating through its export table and comparing the
strings with a custom made strcmp (since they remade all CRT functions). 
* ![Retrieval of LoadLibrary manually from Kernel32.dll](Images/3-RetrievalOfLoadLibraryManuallyFromKernel32Dll.png)

After that, the following DLLs are resolved:
| DLL Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Mpr.dll | Net shares |
| Advapi32.dll | Registry and CryptoAPI functions |
| Ole32.dll | Only for CoInitialize |
| Shell32.dll | Used for some utility functions (discussed later) |
| Iphlpapi.dll | Not used for any function for some unknown reason | 
* ![Resolving multiple libraries used by malware](Images/4-ResolvingMultipleLibrariesUsedByMalware.png)

All APIs are then imported with the previously seen custom GetProcAddress function.

## 2. Global Initialization <a name="2-global-initialization"></a>
After this initialization process, the malware checks if it runs on XP:
* ![Calling CheckIfOnWinXP()](Images/7-CallingCheckIfOnWinXP.png)
* ![CheckIfOnWinXP() function](Images/8-TheCheckIfOnWinXPFunc.png)

It needs to perform that checks to locate the correct directory to store the public key and the
encrypted private key. On higher version of windows it will store everything in /Users/Public and
on windows xp it will store everything in the windows directory:
* ![Locating directory to store keys](Images/9-LocatingDirectoryToStoreKeys.png)

---

## 3. Crypto Initialization <a name="3-crypto-initialization"></a>
Hermes ransomware uses RSA algorithm to encrypt individual AES keys for each files.

Interestingly, this malware contains some unused function that are left like that for example
encrypting using the master public key that is hardcoded in the sample instead of generating a
session keypair:
* ![An unused function containing a hardcoded public key](Images/10-UnusedFuncContainingHardcoredPublicKey.png)

Anyways let‚Äôs see how it actually works.
It first checks if the public key file already exists. If no then it jumps to the RSA keys generations.
* ![Function call to CreateVictimIDAndPublicKeyFiles()](Images/11-CallToCreateVictimIDAndPublicKeyFiles.png)
* ![CreateVictimIDAndPublicKeyFiles() function](Images/12-FuncCreateVictimIDAndPublicKeyFiles.png)

Hermes uses Crypto API (CAPI) for RSA algorithm. It firsts try to initialize many crypto providers based on the Windows XP version check:
* ![Initializing Crypto API](Images/13-InitCryptoAPI.png)

It then generates a RSA-2048 public key and a global AES-256 key and export them to their respective buffers. 
* ![Generation of required keys](Images/14-GenerationOfKeysRequired.png)

And immediately writes the session public key into the `PUBLIC` file:
* ![Generation of required keys 2](Images/15-GenerationOfKeysRequired2.png)

After writing the public key it exports the private key and encrypts it with the previously generated global AES key. It then imports the attacker‚Äôs master public key and encrypts the global AES key:
* ![Writing public key to file](Images/16-WritingPublicKeyToFile.png)

It then writes the the `ID` file which contains: Encrypted RSA Private Key + Encrypted global AES key
* ![Export, Import Attacker Key and Encrypt Global AES Key](Images/17-Export,%20Import%20Attacker%20Key%20and%20Encrypt%20Global%20AES%20Key.png)

After doing all this stuff, Hermes reads the previously created `PUBLIC` file and import the public session key:
* ![ImportSessionPublicKey() function](Images/18-FuncImportSessionPublicKey.png)

---
## 4. General Pre-encryption Setup <a name="4-general-pre-encryption-setup"></a>
Once the cryptographic setup is done, the program decode attackers contact addresses by the same xor algorithm with obfuscated keys as seen before, sleeps for 1 second and proceed to generating the html recovery instructions.
* ![Generation of ransom note](Images/19-GenerationOfRansomNote.png)

It then writes the ransom note to its file:
* ![Write note to disk](Images/20-WriteNoteToDisk.png)

Hermes encryption scheme is multithreaded: It uses a huge array of wchar_t* (`tasks`) that will
contains all file paths.
* ![Array of file paths](Images/21-ArrayOfFilePaths.png)

---
## 5. Scanning for Files <a name="5-scanning-for-files"></a>
Hermes will scan all connected drives and recursively search for files to encrypts except in CD ROMs
* ![Scanning of files except CD-ROM](Images/22-ScanningOfFilesExceptCDRom.png)

It will also enumerates net shares on the local network:
* ![Enumerate Net shares on LAN](Images/23-EnumNetSharesOnLAN.png)
* ![Enumerate Net shares on LAN 2](Images/24-EnumNetSharesOnLAN2.png)

About the recursive file enumeration, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. It uses `FindFirstFileW` and compares the file names against a blacklist to avoid bricking the system.
* ![Compare file names with blacklisted ones](Images/25-CompareFileNamesWithBlacklistedOnes.png)
* ![Compare file names with blacklisted ones 2](Images/26-CompareFileNamesWithBlacklistedOnes2.png)

When a directory is encountered it attempts to write the ransom note two times there and then do the recursion
* ![Try writing ransom note 2 times](Images/27-TryWritingRansomNotesTwoTimes.png)

When a file is found, it compares it to the `ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE` file and the ransom note to not encrypt them:
* ![Compare with ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE](Images/28-CompareWithIDDONOTREMOVE.png)

Else it will add the path to the array of paths to encrypt.

To encrypt a file it performs the following: Loops while the path list (tasks) is empty and sleeps to avoid overloading the CPU. When a path is found in the array, it dequeues it into some allocated memory, breaks the loop and increment a counter (might be used in debug mode) and then creates a thread to encrypt the file faster.
* ![Encrypt file](Images/29-EncryptFile.png)

---
## 6. File Encryption <a name="6-file-encryption"></a>
Inside the encryption thread we can see the following:
* ![Encryption thread](Images/30-EncryptionThread.png)

In this code, the malware encrypts the file and renames it with the the following pattern appended to the original filename: `[attack@mail].HRM`

The file path are stored in some sort of struct passed as a thread parameter from the recursive function.

Let‚Äôs now detail exactly how the encryption works:

It first begins by setting the file attribute to `normal` and then opens the file with `CreateFileW` with write and read permissions:
* ![Create encrypted file](Images/31-CreateEncryptedFile.png)

It then gets the size of the file by calling two times GetFileSizeEx:
* ![Get size of file twice](Images/32-GetSizeOfFile.png)

Hermes then determines if the file is a `big one` or a `small one` by comparing its size.

It will calculate the numbers of chunks to encrypt depending on the size (based on constant values).
Each chunks are 1000000 bytes long. 
* ![Determine if a file is big or small one](Images/33-DetermineIfFileIsBigOrSmall.png)

If the file is considered a `small` one, Hermes will calculate the number of chunks differently:
* ![Calculate number of chuncks for a small file](Images/34-CalcNumberOfChuncksForSmallFile.png)

Hermes will not encrypt the file if it‚Äôs below 25 bytes:
* ![No encryption if the file is under 25 bytes](Images/35-NoEncryptionIfFileUnder25B.png)

Just before proceeding to the encryption part, the malware checks if the file is already encrypted.

To do that, it checks if it contains the appended `HERMES` at the end by setting the file pointer to the beginning of the footer (which is 290 bytes). If the marker is found (the file is already encrypted) and the file doesn‚Äôt have the `.HRM` extension (as seen before), it renames it and exit the function. If it doesn‚Äôt contain the `HERMES` keyword, it reset the file pointer at the beginning and proceed to encrypting the file. 
* ![Checking If Hermes Has Encrypted File Adready](Images/36-CheckingIfHermesHasEncryptedFileAdready.png)

To encrypt the file, Hermes generates a unique AES-256 key for the file:
* ![Generating unique AES-256 key for each file](Images/37-GenUniqueAES256ForEachFile.png)

And then simply proceed to blocks by blocks encryption. If the read bytes count is less than the block it sets the finalize flag to true.
* ![Set finalize to true if the read bytes count is less than block](Images/38-SetFinalizeToTrueUnderSomeCondition.png)

After finishing the encryption of file‚Äôs bytes, it appends the `HERMES` marker after the encrypted content:
* ![Add HERMES marker to file](Images/39-AddHERMESMarkerToFile.png)

The ransomware will encrypt the generated aes key with the session public key (from the `PUBLIC` file) by calling `CryptExportKey` and write the encrypted key at the end before closing the file and cleaning everything up.
* ![Encrypt Generated AES key with the session public key](Images/40-EncryptGeneratedAESKey.png)

## 7. Deleting Shadow Copy and Cleaning Up <a name="7-deleting-shadow-copy-and-cleaning-up"></a>
Hermes creates a batch file which is named `windows.bat` and runs it to remove all possible backups. On Windows XP it will create it in the Windows directory.
* ![Creating of Windows.BAT file](Images/41-CreationOfWindowsBat.png)
* ![Creation of Windows.BAT file 2](Images/42-CreationOfWindowsBat2.png)

Here is the content of that batch file:
* ![Contents of Windows.BAT file](Images/43-ContentsOfWindowsBat.png)

And then runs it with `ShellExecute` with administrator privileges. It will loop this call until the user clicks on `Yes` on the UAC popup unless Hermes is being ran on Windows XP:
* ![Run Windows.BAT file via ShellExecute Under Admin Privileges](Images/44-RunBatchViaShellExecuteUnderAdminPriv.png)

After that, Hermes shows the ransom note using `ShellExecute`, cleans everything and exits.

---
## 8. Bonus Part <a name="8-bonus-part"></a>
As said before there are some functionalities that were disabled such as checking if Hermes is being executed in a CIS country.
* ![CIS country check](Images/45-CISCountryCheck.png)

And also manually scanning specified IPs
* ![Scanning specified IPs](Images/46-ScanSpecifiedIPs.png)

And this explains itself by the fact that Hermes is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) sold on the dark market (dark web). The buyers can ask for custom functionalities for extra price and all of this unused code seems to be those custom functionalities that belongs to other buyers.
